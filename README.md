# OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack<br/>Version 1.1.0

The OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to have the ability to annotate on a local or remote screen.

With the OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack, you can:

- Initiate and manage interoperable annotation features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using.
- Customize the UI features and layout.
- Create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website.

The OpenTok Annotations Accelerator Pack does not include a standalone sample app such as [screensharing-annotation-acc-pack](https://github.com/opentok/screensharing-annotation-acc-pack), though you can easily build your own apps with it. It is also used as a component for more comprehensive Samples that offer such features as screensharing and video along with annotations.
